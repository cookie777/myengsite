# A look-back on the day


I bought rice flour, which is made from rice. Rice flour is a sort of flour but not made from wheat but from rice. Therefore, when you eat bread or some snacks made from rice flour, a blood sugar level increases gradually compare to eating ordinary bread. For this reason, it is said food made from rice flour is good for diabetes.🥯
