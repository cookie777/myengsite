# A look-back on the day

I sometimes use a Bluetooth speaker which is also watertight. I bring it into the bath and while taking a shower, I turn on and listen to the music. You can listen to whatever you want from a computer or smartphone. Additionally, you can bring the speaker into the kitchen and listen to the radio or youtube while cooking! 🧙‍♂️
