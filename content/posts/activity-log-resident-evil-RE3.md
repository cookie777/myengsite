# A look-back on the day

The demo of Resident evil RE3 has just released recently. RE3 is a remake of resident evil 3 which was published almost 20 years ago on the first PS platform. It is a zombie game, which players attack and kill enemies while solving puzzles. This time, it seems RE3 reuses a lot of systems from RE2. Therefore, it looks similar to RE2. 🧠
