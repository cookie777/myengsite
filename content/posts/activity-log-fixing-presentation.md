# A look-back on the day

I've fixed and refined the layout and appearance of the presentation that I use for uploading my video on YouTube. It has been a long time since I last fixed the layout. I applied for some basic design rules that I've learned recently. The looks became much better than before, so I realized that studying is very significant. 😁
