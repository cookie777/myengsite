# A look-back on the day

"Facerig" is a software that can make you disguise different characters on the computer. Usually, when you use a web camera, your real face or body just appears on a computer. However, by using this tool, you can change your looks into different appearances, such as animal, cartoon character and so on. Some virtual Youtubers use this software to disguise themselves. 🧩
