# A look-back on the day

I watched the movie "RAMBO" for the first time. I love watching move and I've been watching a lot of kinds of them but I had never saw RAMBO before. I stared to watch it because it was in lists of Amazon prime videos. It was very interesting and make me consider war. The structure of film is very simple but very impressive. I love this work and I want to see the 2nd one.
