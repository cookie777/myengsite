# A look-back on the day

I surveyed a lot and refined my plan for signing up for the school in Canada. There are 3 essential things which I might learn, one is English, one is preparing for the interview which the school requires, and the other is to study what I learn at the school, which is mainly UI/UX. I know that I can't learn all of these at once, so the significant point is what to do each day, and in order to achieve this, I think it is good to make a concrete plan. Therefore, I surveyed and look into a lot so that I can make a good plan. üòÅ
