# 💡Today's Topic: TENET

TENET is a film directed by Search Christopher Nolan, which is also a director of "Inception", "Dark knight", "Memento", "Interstellar." TENET is his latest film and is going to be released in the middle of July. His movies frequently treat the concept of "time" such as Inception, Memento, Interstellar. TENET also seems to be related to time which is "reverse" or "symmetry." Anyway, it looks very exciting and I'm looking forward to watching it🎞
