# Answer
## Handwriting-note

## Introduction
There are many countries in this world and traveling overseas has great impact on our lives. In my opinion, I would like to visit "India" especially, and I will explain the reason in the following essay.

## Body1
Economically, it won't cost a lot if you go to India. If you spend some countries in Europe for two weeks, it will cost plenty of money, but if you visit developing country, you don't have to pay so much. For example when I was a student , I have once visited Thailand for more than two weeks, and the total cost was very cheap. You don't have to spend much money on transportation, and food in the county is less expensive.  Furthermore, accommodation fee is also reasonable. This example shows that if you travel developing places, it will cost cheaper than usual.

## Body2
From the view point of food, there are many attractive meal in India. There are a lot of spices that they usually use for dishes, curry is a example of this. I often go to restaurant which is run by Indian, and the foods in the facility is very delicious for me. I am obsessed with Indian spices and I have some of them and always use them for cooking. From the above reason, I really want to visit India and experience the real ethnic culture by eating regional food.

## Body3
Culturally, Indian surrounding is totally different from that of Japan. The religion, languages, food, transportation, music and so on. Everything is so different from Japan that staying at that kind of place must be a great experience for me. One of my friend who also went to India often told me that was a great journey. Therefore, I wish to go there. However, it is said that India is a quite dangerous place and many crimes always occur. I know this fact and I also don't think it's a lie, so I will prepare well enough and those kinds of situation are also going to be my great experience.


## Conclusion
In conclusion, I claim that India is one of the best place that I want to go, and this is because of the financial and cultural reasons.
