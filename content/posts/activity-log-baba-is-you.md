# A look-back on the day

I've started the game whose title is "Baba is You." It is a puzzle 2D game and looks simple but actually a very difficult, complicated but sophisticated game. The purpose of the game is to move a character to the gaol like a maze but there are some rules such as you can't pass the wall, you need a key to open the door, you have to push rocks to make ways. The great point of this game, I consider, is you can change those rules while solving. I've just started this game but I've already liked it. 🦝
