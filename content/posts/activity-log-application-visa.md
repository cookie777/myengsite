# A look-back on the day

I've ultimately applied for the student VISA. Recently, I was preparing some documents required for the application. For example, acceptance of letter from the school, bank statement, photo ID and so on. I've collected all of them so that I handed in them to the online website. I also had to fill in a lot of forms and they were low-key laborious. Anyway, all I have to do is just wait until the government sends me an e-mail. I hope it works well. 💪
