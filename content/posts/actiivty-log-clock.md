# 💡 Today's Topic

A Clock, in addition to a watch, has two types, one is analog, and another is digital. Analog is more intuitive to know what time it is but hard to know the precise time. It is also difficult to recognize if it is AM or PM. On the other hand, digital clocks or watches are easy to know AM and PM, but they are not so intuitive🕰
