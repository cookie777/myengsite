# A look-back on the day



I solved several questions of TOEFL, reading, listening and integrated speaking. Especially reading, it was so awful that I felt I wanted to cry. The score was 15 out of 30. Half, just a half of the full. The reading is the most subject I've been working on for these months. I also spend more than 2~3 hours for improving reading, such as vocabulary , comprehension and grammar. Yet, still there are little progress, sometimes becoming worse. I feel really dismal and want to cryðŸ˜¥ Anyway, I'll still practice.

As for listening, particularly integrated speaking part, I think I don't have to take note a lot. Mere a few essential key words are enough for speaking. I think I can concentrate on listening instead of it. Besides, I expect to speak fluently by listening well, because more context and situations are set up in my mind.
