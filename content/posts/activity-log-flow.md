# 💡Today's Topic

Flow state or flow is a mental condition that you are highly and deeply focus on something. This state happens when you are dealing with a very challenging task and also you have enough skills to solve it. If you don't have good talent, your mind will be worry or anxious. On the other hand, if you are not addressing something difficult, it will be boring. This flow state is also called "zone" and makes a person feel pleasant and let him/her be able to work on very hard tasks🧠
