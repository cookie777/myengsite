# A look-back on the day

I bought the "Sekiro", which is an action game and published by "From software". It is known as one of the most difficult action games. Despite the difficulty, it is also said the satisfaction and pleasure are great once you are able to beat the Boss. This means it's really challenging but very worthwhile. In addition, its view of the world is based on the middle Japanese era. I'm really looking forward to playing this game 🤪
