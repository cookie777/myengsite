# A look-back on the day

I cooked a "Nabe", which is a traditional Japanese stew. Nabe is a stew that consists of some vegetables, mushrooms, and meats.  It's not oily and includes a lot of foods so it is very healthy and provides us much nutrition. Furthermore, it is very easy to cook because you only have to boil ingredients that are cut and put the broth into it. The broth is also sold in a supermarket so you don't even have to buy it.ðŸ˜„
