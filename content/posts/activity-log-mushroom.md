# A look-back on the day

There are a lot of kinds of mushrooms. Some are edible and many people have experienced eating them. On the other hand, there are mushrooms that not only inedible but also extremely toxic. It is very hard to recognize which type of mushroom is poison or not unless you are with a specialist. Therefore, even if you are confident or if you have google, you should never consume mushroom that you find by yourself.🍄
