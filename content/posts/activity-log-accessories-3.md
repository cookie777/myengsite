# A look-back on the day

Lately, I'm planning to buy some accessories from Apple. This is because, when I purchased Macbook pro, it was a sale and Apple gave me some gift points as a service. Therefore, I'm thinking to buy an apple pencil, because I have an iPad 9.7.  An Apple pencil is expensive but I'm looking forward to using it. 🤗
