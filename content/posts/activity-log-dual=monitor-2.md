# A look-back on the day

I assembled the dual monitor that I bought recently. To add the second monitor of PC, I bought not only another monitor but also a monitor arm, which is robust and makes monitors move and adjust flexibly. There are still things that I have to do such as organizing cables. Therefore, I haven't completely accomplished yet but it seems it is working well. 😁
