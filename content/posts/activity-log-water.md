# A look-back on the day

Water is one of the most vital elements of a human being. We mostly consume it every day. In Japan, if you want to dirnk water, you can just turn the faucet on and drink it, due to the good quality of water. However, some people including me want to buy water by bottle, because water from a faucet sometimes tastes a little bit weird. If you have a car, you can buy a bottle of water from a supermarket, and if not, you can order from some online store, but it costs a lot compared to buying from a supermarket. 🥛🥛🥛
