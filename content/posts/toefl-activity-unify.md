# A look-back on the day


I organized and unified data of my notes. Notes are particularly for English such as panning for going abroad, what to do to enroll school, ,how to do it, what should I care and so on. I used to write down and stored those data into google sheet, my local PC as markdown or Notion (web-service). Now I mostly arranged and unified and save to Notion. I hope this activity will benefit efficiency and pay off üòÅ
