# A look-back on the day

I've reserved biometrics for the visa. To acquire a student visa, biometrics such as fingerprint and face ID are needed. What is a bother is those registrations are only implemented in the big city, which is Osaka and Tokyo regarding Japan. Therefore, wherever you live, you have to go Osaka or Tokyo once to get register biometrics. This will cost a lot and takes a lot of time. On the other hand, it's my first time to experience such a thing, so I'm a bit excited. 😁
