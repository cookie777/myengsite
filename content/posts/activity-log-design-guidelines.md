# A look-back on the day


I started considering and creating my design guideline, which is applied for my resume. I've learned that whenever creating something it's essential to consider design guidelines (system), which is a kind of basic purpose and rules or principle of the work. What I want to create this time is just a simple Resume so it's not so complicated, but even though, it contains some components such as font-family, font-size, font-color, layout, margin and so on. Therefore, I suppose that this will be a great practice to learn design and also to create a good resume that I'm going to submit to the school. üòÅ
