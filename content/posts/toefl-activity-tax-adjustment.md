# A look-back on the day


I prepared and confirmed the end-year tax adjustment in order to save money. Tax adjustment is very complicated so it's tiring but it's also very significant to manage wealth. I've almost tackled it but there is one question which I can't get it. Therefore, I'm going to ask the company about it and then I hope I can accomplish it ðŸ¤‘
