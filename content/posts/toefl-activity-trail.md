# A look-back on the day

I did the trail about preparation for enrolling in the school. I made the temporary plan recently and it consists of three basic strategies that are English, Interview and UI/UX. To learn each of the fields, I made the plat what to do and then I tried them today. It was a little bit burden than I expected. Thereby, I'm going to refine and revise the plan little by little. ðŸ˜‰
