# A look-back on the day

I bought a book about basic color principle. This is because I thought I should first understand it in oder to learn UI/UX. The book is not actually so academic, nor practical. It embraces really rudiment knowledge and principle about color. The books seems understandable and that is the reason I bought it. Its sill a very basic and little step but I want to progress little by little. üòÅ
