# A look-back on the day

I love watching a movie and I sometimes go to a movie theater. There are some advantages and disadvantages of a movie theater. One drawback is, it is expensive, particularly in Japan, which costs more than 15 $. Besides, if it is crowded and someone is chatting or eating loudly, it will be distractive. Despite those downsides, a movie theater is majestic. The big screen and speaker. I can have a great experience that I will never be able to at home. 🍿
