# A look-back on the day


I cleaned my bath in order to take a bath. This doesn't mean that I don't wash my body everyday. It means that I usually take just a shower, not bath.
In Japan, we typically wash our bodies outside of the bath, and then soak in the bath. This implies that we don't actually have to use bath so those who only take a shower everyday have a tendency that their bathes are not clean enough to soak themselves, unless they clean bathes regularly. Therefore, I cleaned in order that I will be capable to soak in the bath, which meas that I can relax and relieve myself than before. Yes, this is all for TOEFL üòÅ
