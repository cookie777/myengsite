# A look-back on the day


I'm in a sort of rest period. This means, in this week, I'm not gonna study harder than before. Instead, I'm gonna consider my plan for studying and working in foreign country. For instance, what kind of college I'll enter, how will I work after I graduated school and so on. Off course, it doesn't mean that I haven't determined them at all. Partly, I've already decided and this is why I'm studying TOEFL. In contrast, some part of the details are not been clarified yet. Thus, I'm going to examine and also ask the adviser about them. üêÉ
