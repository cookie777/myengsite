# A look-back on the day


I search and study about Font (typography) to create my resume. I don't want to decide font and its properties following my sense or instinct, I want to do it logically. For example, I want to be able to explain when I'm asked: "Why did you choose that font, color, size ?" Therefore, I searched the rules and principles of text and they are very profound and difficult, but it was a good practice and experience for me ðŸ˜†
