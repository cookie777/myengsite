# A look-back on the day
Recently, I always drink instant coffee at home. Only you have to do is to just add bold water. It is very easy to make and cheap. However, the drawback of it is the taste. It tastes much worse compare to the one offered in some coffee shops. I hope I can consume more delicious coffee at home at inexpensive rice easily. 😁
