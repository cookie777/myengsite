# A look-back on the day

I searched how to make a credit card in Canada because it will be necessary and efficient to live three in the long term.  However, the conclusion is it seems difficult to create a credit card as soon as I reach Canada due to the lack of credit. Therefore, my solution is first making a bank account and related debit card instead. And after that, I want to try to make a credit card.
