# A look-back on the day

Today, I had a conversation with some strangers via using MeetUp. It wasn't a sort of party one, but a kind of having chat with using some subjects or topics in sitting on a chair. It was a great experience and good practice for improving English. I'm a shy person and these events make me exhausted but it's very significant so I want to keep on attending these kinds of activities sometimes.üòÅ
