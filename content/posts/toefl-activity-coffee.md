# A look-back on the day

Recently, I sometimes go to "Doutor", which is one of the famous coffee shops in Japan. The reason why I go there is mainly to handle with my tasks and assignments. "Doutor" offers inexpensive coffee for its quality and this is why I often choose this shop. It's not so easy and it's more like burden to go there because I need to bring my laptop or document and the place is located in crowded area, but once I reached there, the efficiency of dealing with tasks is much higher than doing in other places. üßê
