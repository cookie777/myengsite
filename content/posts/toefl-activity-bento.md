# A look-back on the day


Today, I bought some "Bento" in a bulk. In Japan, Japanese lunch box, which consists of lunch in a box, is called "Bento." I sometimes bought them when they get discounted. The discount usually starts late at night (later than 8 a.m) because the supermarket don't want to left old and not fresh foods.

I also study TOEFL speaking. It's been a week since I last practice it. I felt a little bit hard, but I soon get accustomed it.
