# A look-back on the day

I reserved some sort of dinner party that is held thought meetup.com. The event is kind of light and not a serious party, just chatting with having snacks or drinks in 1 or 2 hours. I want to participate in the meetup to practice my English. It's been 1 month since I last joined these kinds of events. This time, the organizer is a stranger for me so I feel nervous and anxious, but I also look forward to meeting somebody else.🥐
