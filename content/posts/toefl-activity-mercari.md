# A look-back on the day


Lately, I've been using "Mercari" which is one of the web-services used to sell stuff, including second-hand, that you bought. It's the most famous service in Japan, even though foreign people might not know about this, so a bunch of people use this app these days. It's very handy because you only have to take some pictures of article that you want to sell, and add some description and set the price. You can to these sequences by only using smartphone within 10 minutes. In other words, it's kind a pretty easy yard-sale that you can conduct by smartphone or computer.
