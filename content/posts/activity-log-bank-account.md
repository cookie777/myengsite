# A look-back on the day
I started organizing by bank accounts to grasp my money. I have serval bank accounts to avoid risk but recently I thought there are too many of them and it is also not decent to have many accounts. Therefore, I've made up my mind to arrange my bank accounts and I'm going to do is reduce or merge some accounts and send or exchange some money, if necessary. 🎸
