# A look-back on the day

I've been searching for some good email client. This is because I have many email accounts that belong to different services and it gets hard to recognize each of its notifications at once. Most people recommend "Thunderbird" if you want to use it for free in windows. However, I don't feel like using it because it used to use it and I didn't like its UI interface. It seems "Mailspring", which is not as famous as Thunderbird looks interesting.  Accordingly, I'm planning to use it. 📧
