# A look-back on the day

I went to school and there, I practiced the interview. Recently, I went there to revise and check what I'm going to say in the interview. This time, I practiced like a real situation; the teacher asked me several questions and I had to answer those. I was nervous and it was difficult to respond because I had to think soon. However, it was also a very good practice for me. I appreciate my teacher.üêü
