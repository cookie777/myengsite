# 💡 Today's Topic

I've been suffered from tax because it is deeply related to my retirement and studying abroad. I have to care about income tax and the resident's tax. Mostly, the company implements the tax return, but this time it's not. I have to understand those taxis, and there are complicated. However, it is good learning for me.
