# A look-back on the day

I stared practicing listening, especially solving TOEFL's listening questions. I was so arrogant that I thought I didn't have to study listening hardly because I thought my listening skill was great. So awful! I've recognize that TOEFL's listening is very difficult and it is required in many situation, not only in listening part but also in integrated speaking and writing part. Listening skill is so vital that I should have improved and enhanced than more. Thus, I refined my studying schedule and add listening practice in it. I also slowed down training reading fast, and instead, I strengthen learning vocabulary. This is because I've realized that there is little effect on reading improvement without studying terms, even if I try and attempt to read passage quickly.
