# A look-back on the day


I'm considering revising my twitter profile. I made my twitter account to collect useful information and output what I did. Recently, I felt like having some feedbacks for my output. To realize this, I need to increase my followers. Therefore, I reckon it's good to have a clear and obvious profile of twitter so people can easily understand I'm doing.👻
