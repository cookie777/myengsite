# A look-back on the day

I checked the setting of the device that will be used for the interview. For example, I inspect that if the web-camera and microphone work fine or not. Surprisingly,  the web-camera didn't work and I had to fix the setting, which means it was worthwhile checking. The interview is going to be held the day after tomorrow and I feel a little bit nervous. However, I did what I was able to do so all I have to do is just stay calm and relax and be confident. 🥩
