# A look-back on the day

I'v been concerning about English college where I want to go. I have not determined yet, and requirements and deadline corresponds to each of them differs. So first I got to consult with adviser and decide the plan, and the deadline and requirements are also defined. However those contents are difficult to decide soon, and some of the deadline are close, so I'm in a hush. What is worse, my skill for TOEFL, particularly reading, has not developed enough. I want to have enough time so that I can do anything with relief â˜˜
