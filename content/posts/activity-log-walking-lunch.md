# A look-back on the day

I started to walk after having lunch. Usually, I take a walk once a day, but I mostly do it in the evening, for instance, 7pm. On the other hand, I always feel very sleepy after eating lunch so to avoid this, I suggest that it will be good to have some exercise after lunch. Therefore, I shift walking to earlier time and so far, it works well. 🦐
