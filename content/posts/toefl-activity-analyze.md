# A look-back on the day


I've been analyzing how to answer at TOEFL. Namely, I'm doing this to Listening and Reading section since there are fairly difficult for me. I've realized that as to Listening, I should not never take a note and always concentrate on imagine the story and grasp the flow. Regarding Reading it is still a little bit hard for me to get a stable grade. However, I think I got it when there are many technical or personal terms and words, such as "Mediterranean", "gypsum", "Gibraltar" and so on. I know that skipping those known word is essential but I guess I need to try to read and understand them more than now. I assume I'm incline to neglect those technical or personal words too much. üòÅ
