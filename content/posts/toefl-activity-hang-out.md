# My Thoughts

Yesterday, I participated in some sort of group which has something to do with English. Actually, I just hanged out with acquaintance and strangers with using meet upüòÅ It was a kind of bar that we met, with some music. I felt nervous and exhausted, because I am shy and timid man, but I had a really great experience last night. Some of them are from or had a experience traveling at Canada. Canada is a country where I want to go, so I was able to get a lot of interseting and useful information. Besides, I talked to many foreigner with using English. It has hard and made me tired but was very good challenging. I want to be engage in them if I have a chance. I really appreciate to those who organizes meet up and who were in the bar üòÑ
