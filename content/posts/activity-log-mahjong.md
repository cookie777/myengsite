# A look-back on the day
Mahjong is one of the Japanese traditional board games. It originally comes from China. The rule is a little bit similar to the poker because you have to pick and select the card and they finally have to make a hand. As poker is, Mahjong contains requires not only skills but also luck, and that makes this game very interesting. The rules of Mahjong are low key complicated so a lot of people including me don't know the details. 🧃
