# A look-back on the day

I have several plush toys. One of then is a dog and looks very adorable. I like plush toys because they make me relax. Also, their texture is pleasant so sometimes I sleep with laying them close to me. The problem is how to wash them because you can't just put them into a washing machine. However, it is very nice to have stuffed animal 🐶
