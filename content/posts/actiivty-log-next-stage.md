# 💡 Today's Topic

This article might be last or not. I'm been recording and writing what I did on that day and uploaded it for more than 400 days. I think it is a great feat and I'm proud of myself. From now on, I'd like to move forward, move on to the next stage. For example, focusing on specific articles, increasing the volume. To realize those things, I might not post or upload every day. I believe this will change and prompt my quality of life. Anyway, I want to say "Good job!" 🥳
