# A look-back on the day


I joined a small dinner party from meet-up.com. It was my first time participating in the group so that I was nervous but it was a fun and good experience to talk to those who come from foreign countries. There, we mostly just talk to each other but sometimes ate snacks and had easy games. 😋
