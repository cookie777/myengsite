# A look-back on the day


Lately, I've been watching some academic videos on YouTube. I know there are a lot of domains in TOEFL, which are more than 30, and it is very significant to comprehend their background. You mean, you don't necessarily have to learn all of them, but the more you understand them, the more you will be able to solve TOEFL firmly.  Until now, I used to learn them from textbooks and some websites but I realized that watching videos specialized in academics is also an efficient way. There are plenty of sophisticated videos on YouTube, and visualization is much easier to understand matters. üòÅ
