# A look-back on the day


I have two belts and both are made by DIY. One is leather from goat and I forgot the other. If you want to make a belt, you have to buy leather and punch and some accessories. You also have to calculate the size and how large holes should be. Additionally, it is important to buy specific cream to maintain the leather. It seems a low-key time-consuming to create a belt, but once you get accustomed to it, it will be fun and interesting. 🥞
