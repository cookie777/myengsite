# A look-back on the day

Umeboshi is one of the Japanese traditional foods that every Japanese must know. This food consists of two main ingredients. One is "ume" or I say Japanese apricot. The other is "shiso" or I say Japanese herb. Both ingredients are unique that we can hardly find in the western world. Anyway, we put ume int shiso with salt and dampen for more than one month. Finally, it gets extremely red color, salty and sour. 😋
