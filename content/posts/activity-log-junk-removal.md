# 💡 Today's Topic


I'm dealing with junk removal recently. Before I go to Canada, I have to dispose of several house appliances and furniture that I cannot bring to Canada and don't need anymore. To discard them, I have to pay a couple of money and it seems it'll cost much hight than I expected. However, I got to accept it because those payments are compelled by the law. I wish I could sell my junk as seconde-hand, but they are all too old and damaged to sell others. Anyway, I'll be a good experience!🪑
