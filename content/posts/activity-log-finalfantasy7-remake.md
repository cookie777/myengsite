# A look-back on the day

Final Fantasy 7 remake is going to be published in April. The quality seems very good and brilliant. This game was postponed a lot of times. It has been around several years since they last announced its release. This time they are not going to sell the whole game, just beginning, because it hasn't been created completely. Although this fact, the game looks very interesting and I want to play it! 🐿
