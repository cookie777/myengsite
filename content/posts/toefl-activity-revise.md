# A look-back on the day

I reviewed and reflected my plan as to practicing TOEFL and English. I revised to decrease practicing writing and speaking because I've realized, while taking TOEFL, that I don't have to study then harder. Instead, I think I still have to enhance my reading and listening skill. Particularly, reading and vocabulary is still insufficient. Now I don't feel like study English a lot since I've taken TOEFL right before, but I want to keep on doing this activity even if it is very slight. Persisting and doing everyday, even if they are subtle, is much more vital than doing extremely at once ðŸ˜„
