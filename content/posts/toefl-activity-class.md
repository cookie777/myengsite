# A look-back on the day



I went to the English class that I usually go once a week. It has been more than 2 weeks since I last visited my school. I was absent my English class for a while because it was after taking the TOEFL test. Then, I decided to diminish the class; taking only 1 class every week (Previously, I took 2 classes each week.) Additionally, I changed what to do in the class, which is mainly conversation, which was previously reading.
