# My Thoughts

Today, I went to Costco in Japan so as to eat dinner. I like Costco because its food is reasonable. The amount of their dishes are large and heave for their prices. I ordered and ete hotdog and some sort of soup. It was really delicious. Although it was packed, I was fairly satisfied. Foods are not so healthy, I think, but I'm thinking to visit here occasionally üòÅ
