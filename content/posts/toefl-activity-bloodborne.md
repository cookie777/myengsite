# A look-back on the day

Lately, I've been playing "Blood borne", which is one of the games published by Fromsoftware. It's a horror and action game and released in 2015. Its system, action and story is very difficult so that a number of people give up playing it. One the other hand, those who overcome them get to really love it because they realize its quality and background behind the game. ðŸ•·
