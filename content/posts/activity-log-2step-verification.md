# A look-back on the day

2-step verification is one of the methods or concepts used for security which requires registration. Usually, when you want to log-in to a service, a username and password are required. One the other hand, some current services also require the second password that is published temporarily via your mobile phone or phone number. This makes security more robust. However, if you go to other countries where you can't use your phone number, 2 step verification might cause a serious problem, because you cant log-in. Therefore, if you go somewhere different, you have to be cautious.🛡️
