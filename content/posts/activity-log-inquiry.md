# A look-back on the day


I made an inquiry to several companies. One is Adobe and the other is Sketch. This is because I want to buy and use Adobe and Sketch service before I'm admitted to the school. However, to buy and use those tools, it seems that there are some rules and limitations that I have to care about. For example, the region. There are some, but vital, issues that come from the region. This time I'm going to change the region from Japan to Canada in the middle. Therefore, I got to be careful about this factor. 🎃
