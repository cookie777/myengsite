# A look-back on the day

Today, I did a more profound meditation than usual. This is because my brain was sort of puzzled by coming up with a lot of thoughts. I guessed my brain was exhausted. 

I also want to clean or arrange my room little by little. I presume that cleaning up at once may be extremely demanding and soon be disordered again. Thus, I don't want to do it at once, instead, I will persist doing it one by one.
