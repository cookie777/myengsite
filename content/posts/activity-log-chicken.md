# A look-back on the day



I love chicken and always eat it. The reason why I consume it every day is that it is inexpensive and contains high protein and less fat. I sometimes buy pork but rarely beef. When I eat chicken, I sometimes bold it or microwave it. Particularly, microwaving raw meat doesn't require time and skill and tools so it is very convenient. 🐔
