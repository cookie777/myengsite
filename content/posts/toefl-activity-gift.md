# A look-back on the day

I searched and determined what to give as a birthday present for my father. I listed up and finally decided to give him a batch of pistachio because I remember that he likes it and especially, made in Iran, not in America. Thus, I'm going to buy it. 

I also did many chores today, such as writing a draft of e-mail, send a message to another community and so on.
