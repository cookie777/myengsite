# A look-back on the day
Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias or mental tendency, which means beginners tend to overestimate their ability despite what they can do. Besides, after that, people are apt to feel deep despair and lose their confidence. Finally, the more they learn and acquire the ability, the more confidence they regain. The important thing is do not overestimate your capability whenever you started something, and keep on learning still after you lose your confidence👌
