# A look-back on the day

I watched a horror movie which is called "Paranormal Activity." The main story is the record of woman and her boyfriend's activity for trying escape from the evil.  The movie was so boring because there are some strange and bizarre points. For example, one of most strange things that I thought was they always let the door open. The evil always came into to their bedroom and do something annoying. However, they always keep the door of their bedroom open until the end. So stupid. ðŸ™„
