# My Thoughts

I've contacted to some sort of community which is about anime, games and some other geek culture. The group performs their activity near where I live. I got in touch to it because I wanted to hang out with someone who has same hobby.  I feel kind of strain to meet strangers but I'm also looking forward to chat or hang out with them ðŸ˜†
