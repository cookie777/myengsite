# A look-back on the day

Today, I went back to my parent's home to stay over. This is because one of my friend is going to hold a wedding ceremony, which is close to my hometown. It took more than 5 hours from my home to my parent's home. When I got on the train I though it was easy to travel such a time, but later, I've realized that I was wrong. I had a faster plan but I did not choose due to the money, you mean I wanted to save money. Although I was able to do it, I won't do it went I return to my home, because it's demanding and worthless, in terms of health and mental ! üòÅ
