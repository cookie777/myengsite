# A look-back on the day

Now, the season of hey fever is coming closer to Japan. In Japan, a bunch of people suffers from hey fever because there are a number of cedars. Cedars make plenty of pollen that makes people running nose, itchy eye and sneeze. I'm one of the victims. Therefore, I have to go to the hospital before the season starts, and receive some medicine to prevent hay fever. 🌲🌲🌲
