# A look-back on the day

I conducted the proceeding of insurance, and mainly met the agency and confirm the contract, deadline and some other documents. It was a burden but necessary for my livelihood. I also send and receive some e-mail with them. ðŸ¤‘ 

By the way, I have to fix my websites, which is still made for TOEFL, and change it to suitable for the preparation for the interview and UI/UX studying.
