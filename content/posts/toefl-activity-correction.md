# A look-back on the day
I corrected my plan and fixed my blog style and youtube content following it. To be specific, I added the "The Interview" and "UI/UX" menu into them. This is not only for promoting my activities but also for grasping my situation and what I should do. I hope this change will make it. ðŸ¤©
