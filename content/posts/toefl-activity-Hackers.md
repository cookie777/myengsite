# My Thoughts

The vocabulary textbook that I ordered recently has delivered today. The title is "TOEFL„ÉÜ„Çπ„Éà „Åß„ÇãÂçò5000". The book is a translated from
"Hackers Vocabulary" which is one of the renown book in Korea. I was a bit anxious about the content, because I had to choose with looking only few pages. There wasn't in a bookstore --just in Internet. However, when I looked over some pages, I realize that this book seems really great ! I has sufficient synonyms. Additionally, the words are categorized by the importance based on TOEFL. This book also has special (technical) terms for TOEFL topics, and this is also very helpful. In short, I think I'm glad to buy this book üòÜ
