# A look-back on the day

I read part of the "Kimetsu no yaiba", which is a famous Japanese comic these days. It is on the comic magazine "Shyo nen jump." I heard that it is very interesting so that I was curious why is so popular particularly in women. I read the comic and I can't still review whether it is great or not. However, I suppose the view of the world is very interesting, it is based on the middle age of Japan and the main character is fighting against the evil, whose feature is very similar to the vampire. I want to continue reading it. üê∏
