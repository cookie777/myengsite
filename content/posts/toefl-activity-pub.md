# A look-back on the day

I went to an English pub and tried to talk to other people. I'm not really good at having a conversation with others, but I want to improve it and this is the reason why I went there. The result was not so good but also bad. I felt very difficult to talk and sometimes I was kind of a clumsy guy. However, I think I did a good job because I tried to enhance myself. üòÅ
