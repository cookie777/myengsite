# A look-back on the day


I have to hand in the Resume in addition to the interview and short essay. ALL are required to enter the school that I want to go to. I have few experiences with each of it so they are obstacles for me but I want to move forward little by little. As for Resume, I searched what we have to write in it. Now I may understand them and them as the next stage I will consider the content and revise them üòÅ
