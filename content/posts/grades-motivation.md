## Introduction
It is said that grades have a lot of effect on students feeling for studyting. In my opinion, I think it is better to show score when they try something. I assert this idea for several reasons, which I will explain in the following paragraphs. +3

## Body1
To begin with, it is much easier to recognize your weakness by using score. You can know what you are good at and what you are not good at. For example, when I was high school student, there were many tests. It was hard, but soon I could understand that I was not good at history , especially about modern events, and it makes me easier to know my problem. Thus, I studied history hard, and finally I became able to understand more about it . So, I think telling score is effective to improve yourself. +11.5

## Body2
From the view point of motivation, sometime showing grades makes people to improve themselves. For examples, when I was a student, I was good at English. One day I had a test and my result was almost 100. This made me happy. Furthermore, there were some people that also got nearly 100 score but no one got 100.  Because of this result, I thought "I wanted to get 100 score. If I had 100, I would be the only one guy in the class!" So I studied English harder than before. This experience shows that showing subjective result sometimes make people more motivated. +10
 +10
## Conclusion
In conclusion, I contend that grades is possible to make people encourage themselve, because  it is able to understand their weakness and strengh, futhermore, it also improves their motivation. +3.5
