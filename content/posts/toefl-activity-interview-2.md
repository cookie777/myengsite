# A look-back on the day

Perhaps, I made up my mind to prepare for the interview. This is because I may have decided the school in Canada I want to go, which requires the interview. I'm gonna take it around January-February. Therefore, I feel a kind of pressure but also excited. Practicing interviews is also a good experience and will benefit skills for living in foreign countries. ðŸ˜†
