# A look-back on the day

"Notion" a web service that can store notes and ideas. It includes multiple functions such as a table, card, and todo list despite its simple and clear design. There used to be a limitation on a free plan, which is only allowed to create a fixed amount of blocks such as words, lines, tables, and cards. However, the recent update shows that there is no more limitation as far as you use as a personal plan. 💡
