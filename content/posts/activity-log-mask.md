# A look-back on the day

These days, Japan is seriously lack of face mask. This is because a lot of people try to buy amount of mask to prevent from infecting covit-19. However, many specialist and also government announce that mask doesn't have such a huge effect on preventing us from virus. Therefore, I claim that we don't have to buy and try to put on mask so strictly. Instead of that, we should wash our hands, keep our body not be cold, eat well and sleep enough.🏮
