# A look-back on the day


I ate Ramen, which is composed of noodles and soup made from livestock and fish. Ramen is one of the most popular junk food in Japan and wherever you go, you are able to eat it such as at restaurants, supermarkets, and convenient stores. You can also make it on your own. Despite its delicious taste and popularity and diversity, it mostly consists of carbon hydrate and salt so that you have to be careful about excessively eating. To care about health (I know the best way is to avoid eating it but I wanted to eat it), I left some part of the Ramen and instead, I ate some vegetables. ðŸ‘»
