# A look-back on the day


I joined in the local geek community and hanged out with them. We ate and drunk together and talk about our hobby enthusiastically. It was a great time. Each person has their own hobby and some people have really niche one. I want to talk to more other people so I am looking forward to join the next party. üòÅ
