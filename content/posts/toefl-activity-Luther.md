# My Thoughts

This time, I could not comprehend the reading passage of Integrated speaking that I practiced today. I could understand partly, but some of words were uneasy for me to imagine, because I was in a rush. I should have and will read passage aloud in my mind, you mean I will read it more carefully üòè



I also started watching "Luther" the TV show (2010) on Amazon prime. It's very interesting ! üòÅ
