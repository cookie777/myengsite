# A look-back on the day


I organized my notes about how to make a design system. The design system is not so complicated nor sophisticated because I made to create my resume. However, it still was a vary great experiences for me. Therefore, to utilize this experience, I wrote down how to make a design system and them now I'm revising it. It is a low key difficult but worthwhile doing. 😁
