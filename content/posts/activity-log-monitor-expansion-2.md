# A look-back on the day

I'm planning to add another monitor of PC to make my surrounding efficient. To achieve this, I've already bought the monitor and I also bought several power strips because it requires additional power plug. I've already bought what I need to construct additional monitor and all I have to do is start making it. I'm planing to do this next week. ♟
