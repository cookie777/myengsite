# A look-back on the day

Tonight, I'm going to eat with some kind of geek group, which are strangers to me. The community is active near where I live and those activities that I found on the Internet look very cool to me so I thought I wanted to talk to them and join it. It is the first time to join it so I feel a little bit nervous but I also am looking forward to meeting them. We are going to eat together tonight. üòÅ
