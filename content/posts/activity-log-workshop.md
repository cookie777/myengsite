# A look-back on the day

I participated in an online workshop. Technically, it's not a workshop but a kind of lecture because only I had to do was to listen and note. What has explained in the lecture was about how to work and study abroad.  To achieve them, what should we do before and after going abroad was mainly explained. It was long, more than 4 hours but extremely useful and important so that I am very thankful to the organizer ðŸ¤£
