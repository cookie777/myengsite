# A look-back on the day


I've transferred money that the school required to enroll. It is my first time to send money to other countries so it is very difficult for me. Additionally, the amount of money that I have to send is large and the deadline is close so I feel worried about it. The payment is going to be completed a few days later so it means it hasn't done yet. That also makes me nervous. Anyway, I did what I can do and all I have to do is wait and keep in touch if I was able to transfer money or not. 🐦
