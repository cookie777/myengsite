# A look-back on the day

I went to the dentist so as to check there is no bad tooth. As I concerned, there was a cavity so I had it removed. I have to go there again to confirm if the treatment works or not. It costs and is a little bit troublesome for me but to keep health teeth is significant, so I will go.
