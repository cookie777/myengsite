# A look-back on the day

Fitts' law is a principle or model, which means how we reach to the target is dependent on the target's size and distance. In other words, the bigger and closer the target is, the faster we can reach it. This seems very obvious and simple. The essential point about this law is we can calculate the speed by using relative variables such as the target's size and distance. This law is still used in a lot of product including applications and web services.🔨
