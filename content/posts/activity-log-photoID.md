# A look-back on the day
I took my photo ID that is required for the student VISA. I can take it by myself at home, but the quality is not so good so that I visited the camera shop. Actually, I visited more than one time and been took several times because, regarding some photos, I wear glasses and my hair covers my eyebrow. I was too nervous about being rejected. This is my advantage and also disadvantage. Sometimes I took something a lot of time to make it perfect. Anyway, I did my best and I want to praise myself! 😊
