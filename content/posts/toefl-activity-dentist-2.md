# A look-back on the day


Today, I went to the dentist again. This is because to do the permanent cure. I went there two days ago and at that time, they just conducted a temporary treatment to examine how serious my cavity is. Then, today, they figured out that my bad tooth was not so grave, which means it didn't heart my nerve deeply, that they finally did the permanent remedy for it. I was glad for it.  I hope it work well and it won't heart any more. üêß
