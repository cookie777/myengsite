# A look-back on the day

I bought a book about layout design. The book I bought shows the rules and essentials of layout, and seems to embrace good contents and looks very easy to read. I believe that to study UI/UX, I first have to understand the really basic rules of design, which are the color and layout principle. I've already bought a book about color. I am planning to read this little by little but every day and want to persist studying it. I hope it works well. ðŸ˜Š
