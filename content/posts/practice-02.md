# Answer
### Japanese-note
大きな影響あり　。私は討論方式を推奨

社会的観点
    討論重要
    会社や生きるために必要、どこにでも役立つ


知識的観点
    効くだけより、より覚えやすい。    また討論するには理解する必要がある     理解力を深めるに役立つ。知識につながる
    正直知識だけならインターネットでゲット
    人と合うチャンス。交流が鍵。しないなら行かなくておｋ


結論。２つてんからディスカッション方式をすすめる


## Intruduction
There is a lot of impact on how the professor teach students. In my opinion, it is better to argue with each other than just doing lecture. I suggest this idea for 3 reasons, which i will explain in following essay.

## Body1
Socially, it is said that communication skills are vital to live. This talen is useful not only when you are working, but also in any other personal situation. If you don't practice discussion, and just listen what people say, you can not make yourself improved. In order to persuade someone or do what you want, you must improve this talent.


## Body2
In terms of knowledge, it is more effective to remember what they are told than just listening the word. When you want to discuss something, you must understand what you are told first. So talking with each other strength your understanding. This means it is more useful than listening your teacher. Besides, if you only want to get information, you don't have to go to class. The meaning of visiting school is to interact someone.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, I prefer doing many discussions in the class from the viewpoint of sociability and knowledge.
