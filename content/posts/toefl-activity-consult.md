# A look-back on the day


I consulted with an adviser about English college and Immigration. The adviser was very kind and considerate so that it was very helpful for me.
However I haven't determined which college to got or even which field to study. My first priority was to improve my English skill, and I'm working on it.
On the other hand, may be it's time to decide what college to go. I'm so indecisive that it's really hard for me to do this, and I'm upset and my stomach is hurt ðŸ˜‚
Anyway, the good thing is that I was capable to keep in touch with consultant and ask some advices. This is a great progress for me.
