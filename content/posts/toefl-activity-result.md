# A look-back on the day

Today, at lats the TOEFL results, which I took last week, has published. The score was 91 out of 120 ! I was much higher that I expected. I'm really delighted for this result ! The specific score is Reading 20, Listening 27, Speaking 23 and Writing 21. The reading and listening grades are pretty good than I thought. This score fulfill a lot of requirement in colleges and organization in foreign country. Particularly, each score of the section is more than 20 and this makes the possibility much higher to enroll those school. This is because some school require not only total score, but also each section's grade (for example TOEFL-ibt 86/ R/W 20, S/L 19. ) My effort and endeavor has paid off and this is going to be a great achievement for me. ðŸ¤£
