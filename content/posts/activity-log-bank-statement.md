# A look-back on the day
I applied for obtaining a bank statement. This is required to get a student VISA. There are several procedures and documents required for student VISA. One of then is my bank statement because I have to prove to Canada that I have enough money and recourse to live in Canada for a long time. It is recommended to have more than 3 million CAD$ per year. It will take a lot of time, around 2 weeks, until the documents reach to my home. Thereby, I hope it will come fast so that I can move forward to the next phase. 🎂
