# A look-back on the day

I've started preparing for obtaining a student visa. Right now, I got school permission so that I can get a student visa. To achieve it, first I have to grasp the procedure and what I have to do. Then, I will make a priority. It seems it's very complicated but I have to accomplish it. I also want to ask my agency's and some other neighbors' advice for a visa. 🐫
