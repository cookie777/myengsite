# A look-back on the day


I had my hair cut. I regularly perform this around every 2 months but this time, I had my hair cut a little bit earlier than usual. This is because I wanted to take an ID photo for student VISA, and I guessed I should make my looks better. There aren't any rules about length and size of hair as for ID photo in VISA but I suppose its better to look tidy or neat. 🐦🐦
