# A look-back on the day



I'm in a rush, because I got to take TOEFL much earlier than I thought. The college "BCIT" which I want to go, stats to accept application from November 1st. BCIT is really famous in Canada, particularly in vancouver because of its demand for job. Thus, a bunch of people also try to go and apply for the college. Additionally, the earlier you apply, the earlier they can accept it. This means that it's pretty better for me to apply for it or I would not enter the college. Therefore, I have to get enough TOEFL score, which is more than 86,  by November. I'm not sure that I can make it. I'm very anxious about it ðŸ˜‚ 

However, all I have to do is concentrate on studying and getting a good score, not be in a rush nor nervous, and believe myself and have self-confidenceðŸ˜‹
