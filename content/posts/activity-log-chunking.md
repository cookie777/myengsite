# 💡Today's Topic

## Chunking

Chunking is an effect, tendency, or principle, which means it is much easier for a lot of people if the information is separated in several chunks, even if the total amount of information is the same. For instance, if you are shown the number "24923529", it is difficult to remember. However, if you make chunk like "249 235 29", it gets much easier to remember. It is said that the number of chucks is recommended to be around 4.📚
