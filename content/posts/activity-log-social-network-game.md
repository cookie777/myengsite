# 💡 Today's Topic

The social-network game, especially, played as a mobile app includes high risks. It is because most Social-network games in Japan have a lottery in the game. To become superior against competitors, users have to get great and rare items that can be obtained from the lottery. And, to use a lottery, users have to spend on a lot of money or time, which can be nothing because it is a lottery. The game itself is interesting and good, but we have to be careful when playing these types of games.🎰
