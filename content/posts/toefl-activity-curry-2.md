# A look-back on the day


I ate a little curry rice. Curry rice is originated from India which consists of multiple spices and other ingredients. When it was imported into Japan, it was customized to Japanese style, more thick, sweet and includes more vegetables. Accordingly, Japanese curry and Indian one is different. Its taste is so attractive that I feel I want to eat every day. ðŸ˜‹
