# A look-back on the day

I'm considering using Adobe xd. Some people say it is a great tool when engaging in UI/UX. I avoid using them because I thought it was expensive but actually, I noticed I can use it by free if I want to use it alone. So I'm thinking of trying to use it but it seems it'll take a while to get used to it and I'm not sure if I can create my resume in time. Anyway, I'll first try to use Adobe xd and then decide to use other tools or not. ðŸŽ„
