# A look-back on the day

I bought several protein bar and cookies. These protein snacks contain more protein and less sugar than ordinary ones. I bought these not only because I want to take protein but also I want to eat something sweet with less sugar. My parent is Diabetes so I don't have it but have to be careful about taking in excessive sugar. The best way to tackle it is not eating any snacks, however, I feel like eating then really much and I believe stress is not good for health. Therefore, I concluded that protein snacks is one of the good solution, because it contains few sugar than usual one. üç™
