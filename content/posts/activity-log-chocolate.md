# A look-back on the day

I love chocolate so I always eat it. I try to buy chocolate which contains cacao more than 80%. Most chocolates stored in shops are very sweet for me and contains a lot of sugar, I guess. There is no problem to eat them if you eat a moderate amount, however, I tend to eat them excessively so I make up my mind to eat those have less sugar, which means those consist of more than 80% cacao. 🍫
