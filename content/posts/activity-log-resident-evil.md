# A look-back on the day



I want to talk about my hobby, which is playing games and one of my favorite series is resident evil. It is a horror game and escaping from town or building where zombies and creatures exist. The system varies depends on the series; some of them are more like surviving with few items and others are more tend to be action games. Anyway, they are all awesome that a lot of people recognize and love this game. ðŸ‘»
