# A look-back on the day


I own soybean because I mostly eat foods that are composed of soybean. For example, "Natto" -- one of the traditional Japanese foods, soymilks, and boiled soybean. When I feel hungry, I don't want to eat something includes an amount of sugar, which means carbon hydrate.  Instead of eating those types of food, I sometimes try to eat foods that contain a lot of protein and less sugar to keep fitness. üê±‚Äçüèç
