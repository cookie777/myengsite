# A look-back on the day

I sometimes use earplugs even when I sleep at my home. This is because even if the surrounding is not noisy, putting earplug increases the quality of sleep. The disadvantage of earplugs is it makes a little bit pressure to ears. Anyway, earplug is very effective stuff to make our life better. 🐸
