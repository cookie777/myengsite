# A look-back on the day


I'm now considering buying Macbook pro because the school I'm going to enroll requires. To buy it, I'm wondering about some options such as the size of the display, the size of storage.  we need Macbook because as a designer, a lot of design tools are suited to mac OS. I will order some additional options so it will cost around 1,800 $. 💰
