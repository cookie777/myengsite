# A look-back on the day



I made pancake that I last did it for a long time ago. It was technically my first time to make pancakes because I have no memory making it. The reason why I wanted to make is I just felt like cooking something sweet. Additionally, when I checked how to make pancake I've realized that it isn't so difficult than I thought. As I expected, it was easy to make and required few ingredients and it was a great time to do it. 🍯
