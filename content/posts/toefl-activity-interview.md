# A look-back on the day


Today, I went to the English school that I mostly go once a week. I used to take 2 classes in a week but from now on, I'm going to have only 1 class. Contents of lessons are also altered; it used to aim for TOEFL but now it is changed for practicing a kind of conversation and an interview. This is because some school requires an interview to enroll and it is also improving conversation is significant and fundamental talent to live in abroad. Therefore, I'm planning to firstly practice conversation, and then, the next stage is to sophisticate the interview.
