# A look-back on the day

I felt tired recently so I tried to stay calm and relax today. I did my usual study but the other time I tried to be relaxing. It's difficult, when you're tired, whether to sleep during the day or not because if you take a nap in the daytime too much, it will be hard to sleep at night.
