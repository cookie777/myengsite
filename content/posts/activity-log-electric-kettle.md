# A look-back on the day

Some electric kettles can boil water instantly, quickly and easily. Only you have to do is just put water into the kettle and push the button. You will able to get hot water for less than 1 minute. You don't need fire, but just electricity. I use electric kettle a least once a day for making coffee or tea. I significantly rely on this kitchen appliance.🥨
