# A look-back on the day

I've bought a new pillow to improve my quality of sleep. Recently, I feel I have a severe stiff neck and especially I do when I wake up. I conjecture that the reason comes from the pillow because it seems not to suit me. Therefore, I bought another new pillow which I hope it will fulfill me. I haven't tested it yet but I hope it will make my sleeping better than before. 🐶
