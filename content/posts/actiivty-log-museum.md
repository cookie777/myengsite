# 💡 Today's Topic

A museum is a place to exhibit something, especially historical or academic things. Museums are a calm, silent, solemn, and very important place. It not only shows historical things to the public but also stores and preserve those things. Without museums, we would lose the penalty of knowledge.🎭
