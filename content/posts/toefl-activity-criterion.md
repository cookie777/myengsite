# A look-back on the day


I got great score in criterion, a web service offered by official TOEFL that evaluate the independent writing, and the grade was 6 out of 6. I sometimes use this service so as to assess my writing skill, and usually gets 5 out of 6, never be 6. However, this time, I was able to attain my best score so I am really delighted to this success !
