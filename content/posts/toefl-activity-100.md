# A look-back on the day


One hundred. It's been 100 times since I stared uploading my activity, particularly for TOEFL, to YouTube. This is really great feat for me. I'm proud of myself 😄 What is more, I uploaded then for everyday. I can't believe that I've done such an achievement ! Persisting is one of the vital elements for studying something, so I'm really delighted to have done it. I still want to keep on this, even if it is a bad quality 🐲
