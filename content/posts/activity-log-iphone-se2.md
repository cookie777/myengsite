# A look-back on the day


I'm planning to purchase iPhone SE2. There was a rumor that Apple was going to sell it in March. However, recently it changed and it is said that Apple is going to postpone and launch selling SE2 in April or later. I want to buy SE2 because its price is reasonable compare to other iPhones. Besides, I want to use the iPhone to create and study about UI/UX design. 🍒
