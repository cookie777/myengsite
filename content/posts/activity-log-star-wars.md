# A look-back on the day

I've watched "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker," which is episode 9 of Star Wars series. It was much better than I thought. This is because my expectation was pretty little due to my evaluation of episodes 7 and 8. This "The Rise of Skywalker" not only offset previous shortcomings of episodes 7 and 8 but also itself was very exciting. Characters, machines, planets, creators and any other things in the movie had a lot of respect for old star wars, episodes 1 to 6. I was very glad to watched this movie. üòÅüòÅ
