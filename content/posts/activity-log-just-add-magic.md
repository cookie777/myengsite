# A look-back on the day

I started watching the TV show "Just add magic", which is a kind of comedy. It is interesting and makes me fun. It's low-key made for kids so some of the English they use is easier to comprehend than those that are used in other TV shows. The main story is the main characters try to heal their grandmother by using a magic book, especially cooking magic dishes. 🍩
