# A look-back on the day


Yesterday, I talked to one of my best friend and ask him some advice about my policy. His was very friendly and gentle. I was very helpful and appreciative for him. To talk about one's personal thoughts or notions need a lot courage and energy, but I was glad that I was capable to confess then to him. I was really released and felt relax. 

I also decided when to take TOEFL test, 10/19, and I'm gonna apply for it üòÅ
