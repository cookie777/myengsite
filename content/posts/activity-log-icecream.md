# A look-back on the day

I bought an ice cream, which I rarely do it. I love eating ice cream but I can't eat it too much. Whenever I eat just a normal size of it, I always become stomach ache. I guess my stomach is pretty weak. To avoid this, I sometimes buy a small size of them or cut ice cream into pieces.
