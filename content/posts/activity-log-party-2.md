# A look-back on the day

I participated in a drinking party via meetup.com. Some are strangers and others are neighbors for me, and we introduced ourselves and talked to each other. Some are from out of Japan such as America, China, Shigapol, India, and Philippine. Others are Japanese. I was pleased to have a conversation and it was a good experience. Actually, I'm not good at talking even in Japanese but I like to talk to other people. I appreciate the organizer and those who talked to me. 😊
