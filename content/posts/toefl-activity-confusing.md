# A look-back on the day


I did a attempt for Integrated speaking question, which is not to take any notes while listening. It makes the comprehension of listening well but the speaking quality worse. I've reached to the conclusion that taking mere few important keywords will work, which I mentioned yesterday.

By the way, lately I feel my brain is exploding. Maybe I'm apt to study too much, even I don't think, but my head is requiring vacation. I don't want to stop doing because there are few days until the actual TOEFL test, less than 20 days. I'm in a rush, but the more I feel upset, the more relax I think I got to be, so as to make more efficient and effective outcome. ðŸ‘»
