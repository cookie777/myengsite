# A look-back on the day


I considered a next plan, what should I do each day. I regularly revise what to do next to fix my activity. This time, I changed my text book of vocabulary, added one text book for design principles and I'm also planning to add some practice of programming, especially about javascript. Instead of those practice, I will reduce preparation for the interview. I hope it will work well. ðŸ¦„ðŸ¦„ðŸ¦„
