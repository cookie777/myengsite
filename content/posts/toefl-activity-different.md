# My Thoughts

The question of TOEFL integrated speaking that I answered today, was totally different from usual type. The question type (part 3) is always about explaining specific definition of the word with speaker's example. However, this time, it was about the professor's advices to student's problem and then I was asked to summarized them and also to select of the solution with my reason. That was very different and I was a little bit confused because I was never asked to choose some way and to answer I chose it. It was kind of Independent speaking. It was very good practice. What I think is essential is, whatever the question is, I think I should speak introduction, outline and conclusion. ðŸ˜‰
