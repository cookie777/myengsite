# 💡Today's Topic: Similarity

The law of similarity is one of the principles of Gestalt. It means that if there are several objects with similar features, people tend to recognize them as the same group and related. These features indicate the shape, size, and color. What we can learn from this law is if we want to show some objects that have the same functions or systems, we should make them look the same. In other words, if there are several objects or things that have different features, we must not make them look similar🍩
