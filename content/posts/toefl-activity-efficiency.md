# My Thoughts

I modified my blog content in 2 large points. 
Firslty, I 've made a new template which uses chechbox.   I used to write my blog wih just a copy and paste, but I've noticed that using chechbox makes my reporting much easier. Thus, I adopted it.
Secondly, I have made up my mind to use English in addition to  Japanese. This will cost a little bit time and energy, but I hope that it will improve my English skills. 

チェックボックス式にして見やすく、楽に書けるようにした！
そして英語を取り入れるようにした！
