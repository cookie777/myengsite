# A look-back on the day

Dragon is a very common but not existed creature in the world. There are many types of dragons such as flying of not, use magic or not, live in water or not, friendly or enemy, and so on. The interesting point of this animal is there are a lot of similar descriptions and historical records all over the world despite its era. In old times, it must have been difficult to communicate or interact with other countries or cultures. However, a lot of similar records about fantasy creatures, that are close to the dragon, are also found in Asia.
