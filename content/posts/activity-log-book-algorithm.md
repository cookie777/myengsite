# A look-back on the day


I ordered two new books on Amazon.jp. One is about some principles of design, and another book is about the basic algorithms. The latter one is not so complicated and it is more for beginner, which includes a lot of images and illustrations. I bought this book because I wanted to review and study basic algorithms for programming and this domain is related to UI/UX. üêí
