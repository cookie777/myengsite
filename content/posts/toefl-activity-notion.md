# A look-back on the day


Today, I tried to organized my tasks and assignments. This is because if some tusks emerge, they become complicated to solve or even recognize what to do. In order to solve them efficient, I reckon I need somehow useful tool or web-service such as notion or mind-map.
"Notion" is one of the effective web-services which is released recently and can arrange and coordinate tasks and schedules. It possesses multiple features so that it's a little bit demanding to use, but once you can master it,I assume and hope, it will be a significant solution of assignments. I'm wondering using "Notion" or other tool like mind-map instead, but anyway I will firstly try to use Notion and them reflect my idea.
