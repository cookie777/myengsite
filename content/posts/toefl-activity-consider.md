# A look-back on the day

I considered and reflected what to do from next. I've already acquired enough score as for TOEFL. There are several ways for option and one is to refine TOEFL skill and get higher score, one is challenge to take IELTS just in case, and one is to learn and improve how to do an interview because some school require it. Anyway, my priority is to counsel the consultant and consider what school to go and what to prepare.
