# A look-back on the day



I took TOEFL. I think I did my best. However I feel so frustrated, especially for listening, because I reckon I could have done better. I made a lot mistakes in listening in spite of my knowledge to solve it. This is all because of my weariness. I took plenty of energy fro Reading. I know I was able to get great score in Reading but I don't regret it since I recognize my skill, although as to listening I'm really frustrated because I think myself I am capable to solve and comprehend better. However, I think I did really well. This is because even I did some mistakes I didn't regret for a long time during the test, and then changed my mind and solve other questions. This switching of mind and recovery is the best achievement I did in this test. I really want to compliment and acclaim about this. Well done and good job ! ðŸ˜†
