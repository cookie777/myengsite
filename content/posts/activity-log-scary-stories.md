# A look-back on the day

I watch the movie "Scary stories to tell in the dark," which is a horror movie originated from a book. My review is it was amazing and I love. I love movies that combine horror and tale or something a little bit set sights on children, such as "IT." Besides, the design of creatures and monsters are brilliant! So creepy and impressive. It was worthwhile seeing 🕷
